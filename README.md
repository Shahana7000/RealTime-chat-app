# RealTime-chat-app
Socket.IO is a powerful JavaScript library and framework built on top of Node.js that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It uses WebSockets as its underlying technology but also provides fallback options like long polling, making it highly reliable across different environments and browsers. Socket.IO is commonly used to build chat applications, live notifications, gaming systems, and collaborative tools where low-latency data exchange is essential. It consists of two parts: a server-side library for Node.js and a client-side library that runs in the browser. With features like automatic reconnection, broadcasting, and event-based communication, Socket.IO simplifies the development of real-time web applications. It also supports namespaces and rooms, helping developers manage communication channels efficiently.
